## Before Watching

**Framing Question:** What does it mean to be a mathematician? As you watch, notice how Mirzakhani approached her work—her tools, her persistence, her visual style—and how her path was shaped by the world around her.

**Context:** Maryam Mirzakhani (1977-2017) was an Iranian mathematician who became the first woman to win the Fields Medal, often called the "Nobel Prize of mathematics." This documentary explores her life, her work on surfaces and billiard dynamics, and her lasting impact.

## Key Moments to Watch For

| Approx. Time | What Happens | What to Notice |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Early** | Growing up in Tehran during/after the Iran-Iraq War | How did historical context shape her path? |
| **~10 min** | Her problem-solving style: working on giant sheets of paper | Her daughter thought she was "painting" |
| **~15 min** | Winning gold at International Math Olympiad (twice) | Community of mentors and classmates |
| **~20 min** | Moving from Iran → Harvard → Stanford | The journey of an immigrant mathematician |
| **~25 min** | Her work on billiards and surfaces | The math that connects to Paper Pool! |
| **~28 min** | Winning the Fields Medal (2014) | Why was this historic? |

## While Watching

Jot down notes on these prompts (you'll use these for Part 1 of PS3):

1. **Key Moments:** What surprised you? What moved you? (Note approximate timestamps)

2. **Questions:** What do you want to know more about? (Her math? Her life? Iran? The Fields Medal?)

3. **Her Style:** How did she approach problems? What was distinctive about her way of working?

4. **The People:** Who supported her journey? What role did community play?

## After Watching: Discussion Questions

1. Mirzakhani said she wasn't always excited about math—she wanted to be a writer. What changed? When did you first get excited about something you weren't expecting to love?

2. The documentary emphasizes her "persistence" and working on huge sheets of paper covered in drawings. How does this compare to how math is usually taught in schools?

3. Mirzakhani grew up during a time of war and revolution, yet Iran invested heavily in math olympiad training. What does this tell us about how different cultures value mathematics?

4. She was the first (and still only) woman to win the Fields Medal. Why do you think that is? What barriers exist for women in mathematics?

## The Big Question for Problem Set 3

> **How do you find patterns in geometric situations—and how do you share a mathematician's story with young learners?**

This is what Mirzakhani did with billiards. This is what you'll do with Paper Pool and miniature golf.
