## Part 1: The Mathematician — Documentary Viewing (5 pts)

*Purpose: Engage deeply with Mirzakhani's story through the documentary. Notice what surprises you and develop questions that will guide your research.*

In class, you'll watch substantial portions of *Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Maryam Mirzakhani*. As you watch, capture moments that stand out and questions that arise.

### (a) Key Moments (3)

Record 3-5 moments from the documentary that surprised, moved, or intrigued you. Include approximate timestamps and explain why each moment stood out.

| Timestamp | What Happened | Why It Stood Out |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### (b) Questions for Research (2)

Write at least 5 questions about Mirzakhani's life and/or work that you want to explore further. These will guide your research in Part 3.

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5.

## Part 2: The Math — Paper Pool Patterns (10 pts)

*Purpose: Explore number patterns through the Paper Pool applet. Notice relationships between dimensions, bounces, and corner pockets—without rushing to formulas.*

A ball is shot from the lower-left corner of a rectangular table at a 45° angle. It bounces off walls until it lands in a corner pocket.

**Your tool:** [CMP Paper Pool Applet](https://media.pk12ls.com/curriculum/math/cmp3/activities/A82399/index.html)

### (a) Exploration Data (3)

Explore at least 8 different table dimensions. Record what you notice.

| Dimensions (m × n) | Number of Hits | Which Pocket? | Other Observations |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### (b) Pattern Discussion (5)

Describe the patterns you noticed. Consider:
- What determines the number of hits?
- What determines which pocket the ball lands in?
- Are there dimensions that behave similarly? Why might that be?

Write your discussion as a conversation between triad members—who noticed what? Did you build on each other's ideas?

*Write 200-300 words:*




### (c) MIRA Reflection (2)

In class, you used a MIRA to trace reflection paths on paper "golf holes." How did the hands-on MIRA experience connect to the Paper Pool applet? What did each approach help you understand?

*Write 75-100 words:*

## Part 3: The Research — NotebookLM Deep Dive (10 pts)

*Purpose: Use AI-assisted research to explore the context around Mirzakhani's life and achievements. Focus on what would help you tell her story to young learners.*

Create a NotebookLM notebook and add these curated sources (available in our course materials):
- Secrets of the Surface transcript
- Fields Medal video transcript  
- Maryam Mirzakhani Wikipedia article
- Quanta Magazine: "New Shapes Solve Infinite Pool-Table Problem"
- "My Favorite Lesson: Miniature Golf" article

**You may add additional sources** to your notebook. Note any additions in Part 3f.

Research **one topic from each** of the 5 categories below. Write ~75-100 words per response.

### (a) Persian/Islamic Math History (2)

How does Mirzakhani's work connect to the rich mathematical tradition of Persia and the Islamic world? Consider mathematicians like al-Khwarizmi, Omar Khayyam, or others.




### (b) The 1979 Revolution & Its Impact (2)

Mirzakhani grew up in post-revolutionary Iran, during and after the Iran-Iraq War. How did this historical context shape her path to mathematics?




### (c) The Fields Medal (2)

What is the Fields Medal? Why is it significant? What made Mirzakhani's win historic?




### (d) Women in Mathematics (2)

What barriers have women faced in mathematics? How did Mirzakhani's achievements impact conversations about women in STEM?




### (e) Her Problem-Solving Style (2)

How did Mirzakhani approach mathematical problems? What was distinctive about her visual, persistent style? How did her daughter describe what she saw her mother doing?




### (f) Sources Added (optional)

If you added sources beyond the five provided, list them here and briefly explain why:

## Part 4: The Teaching — Create a GeoGebra Golf Hole (5 pts)

*Purpose: Apply your understanding of reflections by designing an original miniature golf hole that requires geometric reasoning to solve.*

In class, you solved assigned GeoGebra golf holes using reflection strategies. Now create your own.

**Your tool:** [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/geometry)

### (a) Your Golf Hole Design (2)

Create a GeoGebra golf hole with:
- A tee (starting point)
- A hole (target)
- At least 2 obstacles or walls
- A solution requiring 2+ reflections

**Paste your GeoGebra link here:** ______________________________

**Include a screenshot of your hole:**

[Insert screenshot here]

### (b) Your Answer Key (2)

Show the solution to your hole:
- Mark the reflection points
- Draw the ball's path
- Explain your reasoning (~50-75 words)

**Paste your solved GeoGebra link or screenshot here:** ______________________________

**Explain your solution:**




### (c) Reflection: Growth & Comparison (1)

How has your approach to researching mathematicians evolved across the problem sets? Compare your process in PS1 (Nightingale) or PS2 (Graunt) to your process now.

*Write 50-75 words:*
