# Picture Book Audio Recording

## TCE 265 — Spring 2026

**15 points** | **Due: Thursday, May 15 at 11:59pm**

## Overview

Bring your picture book to life with your voice! Record yourself reading your complete picture book aloud, using pacing, expression, and character voices to make the story engaging for young readers.

Picture books are meant to be read aloud. This assignment asks you to perform your book as a read-aloud, demonstrating how the story sounds when shared with an audience.

## What to Submit

### 1. Audio Recording (10 points)

Record yourself reading your complete picture book (16-24 pages). Your recording should include:

- **Clear audio quality** — Use a quiet space, speak clearly into your device
- **Expressive reading** — Use vocal variety, emotion, and enthusiasm
- **Appropriate pacing** — Not too fast, not too slow, with natural pauses
- **Character voices** (optional but encouraged) — Differentiate voices if your story has dialogue
- **Smooth flow** — Edit out long pauses, major mistakes, or "ums" (minor imperfections are fine!)

**Technical specs:**
- Format: MP3, M4A, or WAV
- Length: Likely 3-8 minutes depending on your book
- Tools: Phone voice memo app, Audacity (free), GarageBand, or any audio recording software

### 2. Recording Reflection (5 points)

Write a brief reflection (300-400 words) addressing:

1. **Process**: What was it like to record your book? What surprised you?
2. **Choices**: What vocal choices did you make (pacing, voices, emphasis)? Why?
3. **Audience**: How did reading aloud help you think about your young audience?
4. **Learning**: What did this teach you about picture books and read-alouds?

## Tips for Success

### Before Recording

- Practice reading your book aloud 2-3 times
- Mark places where you want to pause, emphasize, or change your voice
- Time yourself — does the pacing feel right?
- Find a quiet space with minimal background noise

### During Recording

- Stand up or sit up straight (helps with vocal projection)
- Read at a natural speaking pace (imagine reading to a classroom)
- If you make a mistake, pause, then start that sentence/page again
- Don't worry about being perfect — authenticity matters more

### After Recording

- Listen to the full recording — does it flow well?
- Edit out long pauses or major mistakes
- Check audio levels — can you hear clearly?
- Export in a standard format (MP3 recommended)
