# Script Creation Tips: Allegory of the Cave
**TCE 265 — Problem Set 4**

---

## What Plato Wrote vs. What You're Creating

Plato's *Allegory of the Cave* is a **philosophical dialogue**—Socrates describes a story to Glaucon. But you're turning it into a **performable play**. That means you need to add things Plato only hinted at.

| Sheehan says... | A play needs... | Your ideas? |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| "prisoners who have been chained since childhood" | **Characters with names** — Who are these prisoners? What are their personalities? | |
| "they would take the shadows for real things" | **Action** — What are they *doing* when they watch the shadows? Arguing? Competing? | |
| "being forced to run toward the light" | **Emotion** — How does the freed prisoner feel? Terrified? Excited? Resistant? | |
| "eyes dazzled by the flames" | **Stage directions** — How do actors show this? Shielding eyes? Stumbling? | |
| "they would put him to death" | **Conflict** — What builds to this moment? Who says what? | |

## Questions to Get Started

Before you start writing, talk through these with your group:

**🎭 Setting**
- What does your scene's location look like? Sound like?
- What props or lighting would help the audience understand where we are?

**👤 Characters**
- Who are the people in your scene? (Give them names!)
- What do they want? What are they afraid of?

**⚡ Conflict**
- What's the tension in your scene?
- What's at stake?

**🔄 Transformation**
- How does someone or something change during your scene?
- What's different at the end than at the beginning?

## After Brainstorming: Ask GenAI

Once your group has ideas, you can use AI tools to help expand them. Try prompts like:

> *"We're writing Scene 2 of a play based on Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Our scene covers the freed prisoner's journey from the cave to the outside world. We've named our character Kira, and she's skeptical but curious. Can you help us draft dialogue for the moment she first sees real objects instead of shadows?"*

Or:

> *"We need stage directions for a moment when a character's eyes adjust to bright light. What physical actions could show this?"*

**Remember:** GenAI is a collaborator, not the author. Start with YOUR ideas, then let AI help you expand them.

|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Triad A** | Scene 1: The Cave + Liberation | Prisoners watching shadows → One is unchained |
| **Triad B** | Scene 2: The Ascent | Painful climb → Seeing real things → Seeing the sun |
| **Triad C** | Scene 3: The Return | Going back → Not being believed → [ending?] |
| **Pair D** | Production Crew | Set design, transitions, Narrator script |
