# Reading the Allegory: A Peek at the Greek
**TCE 265 — Problem Set 4 Pre-Reading**

---

Plato wrote the *Allegory of the Cave* around 375 BCE, in ancient Greek. The translation you'll read tonight is by Thomas Sheehan—but he made choices. Every translator does. 

Here are three Greek words from the Allegory. Your job: **find where Sheehan uses them, and figure out how he translated them.**

---

## Word 1: **σκιά** (*skia*)

This word appears throughout the Allegory. The prisoners are looking at something on the wall.

**Your task:** What English word does Sheehan use for σκιά? Find a passage and copy it here:

**Think about it:** This seems like an easy one. But is a σκιά the same as a shadow? Or could it be a silhouette? A reflection? An image? Does it matter?

## Word 2: **ἀλήθεια** (*alētheia*)

This is the goal—what the freed prisoner finally grasps when he reaches the sunlight.

**Your task:** What English word does Sheehan use for ἀλήθεια? Find a passage and copy it here:

> _______________________________________________________________

**Here's what's interesting:** In Greek, ἀλήθεια comes from *a-* (not) + *lēthē* (forgetting, concealment). 

So ἀλήθεια literally means: **"un-concealment"** or **"un-forgetting."**

It's not "truth" as in "correct facts." It's truth as *revealing what was hidden.*

**Think about it:** How does this change what happens in the cave? What is being "unconcealed"?

---

## Word 3: **παιδεία** (*paideia*)

This word appears at a crucial moment—Socrates tells Glaucon what the whole allegory is actually about.

**Your task:** What English word does Sheehan use for παιδεία? Find a passage and copy it here:

> _______________________________________________________________

**Here's what's interesting:** Παιδεία comes from *pais* (child). It's often translated as "education"—but it means something bigger: the whole process of forming a human being. Cultivation. Becoming who you're meant to be.

**Think about it:** You're going to be teachers. What does the Allegory of the Cave say about what education really is?

## The Bottom Line

Every translation is an interpretation. Sheehan made choices. Other translators made different choices.

As you read tonight, notice how Sheehan's choices shape your understanding.

Thursday, we'll talk about how to turn this philosophical dialogue into a play.
