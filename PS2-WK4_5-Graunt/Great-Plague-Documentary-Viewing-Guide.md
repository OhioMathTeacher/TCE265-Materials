## Before Watching

**Framing Question:** You lived through the COVID-19 pandemic. You watched daily death counts, learned about exponential curves, and experienced lockdowns. As you watch this documentary about the 1665 London plague, look for parallels—and differences.

**Context:** This documentary follows one small alley in London (Cock and Key Alley) during the Great Plague. The records come from parish church wardens who tracked every penny spent—and every death.

## Key Moments to Watch For

| Timestamp | What Happens | COVID Connection |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **9:40** | Introduction of the **Bills of Mortality**—weekly one-page reports listing deaths by cause and parish | Daily COVID dashboards, county-level tracking |
| **10:00** | "You are looking at the world's first health data. There was never health data before this." | First time many of us watched public health data in real-time |
| **10:30** | Deaths listed by cause: "Teeth—27 people died of teeth this week" | Debates about COVID cause-of-death classifications |
| **12:00** | "The year 1664 is a big deal. It's the year of the plague." | March 2020 |
| **13:00** | Watching the numbers rise: Plague 0 → 17 → 43 → 112 → 470 → 725 → 1,843 | Exponential curves everyone learned to read |
| **13:30** | "This is a city of only 500,000 people" | Scale comparison—London then vs. your city now |
| **14:00** | Peak: **7,165 people die in a single week** | Worst weeks of COVID in major cities |
| **14:30** | "The plague then starts to peter out... for the first time in human history, **a pattern appears in the data**" | The moment data becomes predictive |
| **15:00** | Privy Council orders: infected houses shut up, doors marked with red cross | Quarantine orders, isolation protocols |
| **17:00** | Dogs and cats killed (40,000 dogs destroyed)—ironically removing the animals that would have killed the rats spreading plague | Unintended consequences of pandemic policies |
| **19:00** | Plague orders issued—"kneejerk response... lock the people up, quarantine 40 days" | Government response debates, lockdown policies |
| **21:00** | First victim in the parish: Dorothy Chesington, 12 years old | When data becomes a person |

## While Watching

As you watch, jot down notes on these prompts:

1. **Data as Story:** How do the Bills of Mortality turn individual deaths into a collective narrative?

2. **Patterns:** At what point do you think people started to see the plague as *predictable* rather than random punishment from God?

3. **Parallels:** What felt familiar from your COVID experience? What felt completely foreign?

4. **The Watchers:** Parish officials tracked every death, every penny. Who plays this role today?

## After Watching: Discussion Questions

1. The documentary says "for the first time in human history, a pattern appears in the data." Why is this such a big deal? What changes when death becomes *predictable*?

2. The wealthy fled London. The poor were locked in their homes. How did the pandemic affect different social classes differently? Did you see similar dynamics during COVID?

3. The Bills of Mortality were published weekly and sold for a penny. Who was reading them? Why would ordinary people want this information?

4. John Graunt—a haberdasher (cloth merchant) with no formal training—would later analyze this data and essentially invent statistics. What does it tell us that an amateur, not a doctor or scientist, made this breakthrough?

## Connection to Jay Walker Video (5 min)

After the documentary segment, we'll watch a short TEDMED talk that explicitly names **John Graunt** and explains what he did with this data:

- From the Bills of Mortality comes **statistics**
- From the Bills of Mortality comes **probability**
- From the Bills of Mortality comes **insurance**
- "This is the world's first pattern of data, and it changes human imagination forever."

## The Big Question for Problem Set 2

> **How do you find patterns in messy, incomplete, historical data—and what do those patterns mean?**

This is what Graunt did. This is what you'll do.
