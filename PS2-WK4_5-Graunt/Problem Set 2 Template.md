## Part 1: The Math — Comparing the Bills of Mortality (5 pts)

*Purpose: Analyze historical data using the tool of your choice. Discover what patterns emerge when you compare a "normal" year to a plague year.*

John Graunt analyzed London's Bills of Mortality—weekly death records—and discovered patterns no one had noticed before. You'll do the same.

**Your data:**
- [Bills of Mortality 1605-06](https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/TCE265-Materials/raw/main/PS2-WK4_5-Graunt/Graunt%20Tables%201605_06.png) (a relatively calm year)
- [Bills of Mortality 1664-65](https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/TCE265-Materials/raw/main/PS2-WK4_5-Graunt/Graunt%20Tables%201664_65.png) (the Great Plague year)

**Your tool:** Choose ONE primary tool for your analysis:
- **GenAI** (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, or NotebookLM)
- **Desmos** (https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
- **Google Sheets**

**Your deliverable:** A 2-3 minute video featuring all three triad members. (5)

### Video Requirements

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **The Questioner** | Poses the driving question(s), asks follow-ups |
| **The Demonstrator** | Shares screen, shows the data/tool in action |
| **The Synthesizer** | Summarizes findings, connects to bigger picture |

Your video must:
- Feature all three members (faces and/or voices)
- Show the actual data comparison (1605-06 vs 1664-65)
- Demonstrate your chosen tool in action
- Use correct mathematical terminology
- Explain what the tool helped you discover

## Part 2: The Story — Research via NotebookLM (10 pts)

*Purpose: Use AI-assisted research to go deeper than a quick Google search. Find the human story behind the math—details that would resonate with young learners.*

Create a NotebookLM notebook and add these curated sources (available in our course materials):
- John Graunt biography (Wikipedia)
- Jay Walker TEDMED transcript ("Hidden Aspects of Death")
- "John Graunt on Causes of Death" (Graunt's original analysis, 1662)
- McGill biographical sketch (GrauntEoB.pdf)
- Great Plague Documentary Viewing Guide

**You may add additional sources** to your notebook. If you do, they should be:
- Peer-reviewed articles, or
- Primary sources (e.g., original historical texts), or
- Reputable journalism (major publications)

Note any sources you added in Part 2c.

### (a) Key Findings (~250-300 words) (4)

What are the most important things you learned about Graunt's life, work, and impact?

### (b) Surprising Quotes/Facts (3)

List 2-3 items that surprised you or would hook young learners:

1. 

2. 

3. 

### (c) NotebookLM Reflection (~75-100 words) (3)

How did you use NotebookLM? What features helped? What didn't work as expected? Did you add any sources? Which ones and why?

## Part 3: The Teaching — 5 Classroom Ideas (10 pts)

*Purpose: Generate creative, concrete ideas for bringing Graunt and data analysis into a math classroom. Quantity over perfection—you're brainstorming, not lesson planning.*

Brainstorm 5 teaching materials or experiences connecting Graunt and data analysis to grades 4-9 math. Choose **one idea from each** of the 5 categories below:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Data Investigation** | Students analyze real, messy, or historical data to find patterns |
| **Compare & Contrast** | Side-by-side analysis of two data sets or time periods |
| **Interactive Tech Activity** | Sheets, Desmos, or AI-assisted data exploration |
| **Cross-Curricular Link** | Connects math to history, public health, or epidemiology |
| **Discussion Prompt** | Open question about what data can (and can't) tell us |

For each idea: category, brief description (~50-75 words), and target grade band (4-5, 6-7, or 8-9). **(2 pts each)**

### (a) Idea 1: (2)

## Part 4: Reflection — Tools & Methods (5 pts)

*Purpose: Reflect on your analytical process and how it compares to historical methods. Consider how you might use these tools with your future students.*

### (a) Poster Photo (1)

Include a photo of your completed poster from the Poster Relay. Make sure all three sticky notes (yellow, pink, green) are visible in the image.

**[Insert photo here]**

### (b) Sticky Note Reactions (2)

Choose 2-3 sticky notes from your poster to react to. For each one:
- **Type the text** from the sticky note
- **React:** Did it surprise you? Improve your idea? Misunderstand your intent? Give you a new direction?

**Sticky 1:**
> [Type the sticky note text here]

*Your reaction (~50 words):*

**Sticky 2:**
> [Type the sticky note text here]

*Your reaction (~50 words):*

**Sticky 3 (optional):**
> [Type the sticky note text here]

*Your reaction (~50 words):*

### (c) Tool Analysis (~50-75 words) (1)

Which tool (GenAI, Desmos, or Sheets) seemed best suited for analyzing the Bills of Mortality data? Why? Which would you use with middle school students—and does order matter?

### (d) Comparing to Graunt (~50-75 words) (1)

How did your approach to the Bills of Mortality compare to Graunt's approach in the reading? What did he notice that you missed—or vice versa?
